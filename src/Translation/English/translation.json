    "visionMissionText": "In Switzerland, more than 150 million kilometers are driven by car every day. At the same time, the cars are often barely loaded: On average, only 1.6 people sit in each vehicle and the increasingly large trunks are mostly empty.\n\nPortato has set itself the goal of making better use of these many free transport capacities. Every carpool potentially avoids another transport trip and means one less car on the road. Our vision is to thus make road transport more efficient and make a positive contribution to the environment.\n\nOur immediate mission is to facilitate carpooling between private individuals. On the one hand, this makes it more convenient to ship (bulky) items. On the other hand, we enable drivers to use their free space wisely, earning money in the process and reducing their ecological footprint.",

  "FAQ": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "senderQuestion": "How does it work as a sender?",
    "senderAnswer": "Simply provide details of your transportation request, including info about the item, pick-up and delivery addresses, and your preferred time frame. We'll then match you with a driver who is going a similar route. Once matched, you'll receive a notification via email.",
    "purchaseQuestion": "I bought something on Tutti or Ricardo and have to pick it up. Can I request a pick-up through Portato?",
    "purchaseAnswer": "Absolutely! As a 'sender', you're the one creating the transportation request. You don't necessarily need to be the person at the pick-up location. You could also be the recipient waiting for the delivery at the other end.",
    "feeQuestion": "How much does a delivery with Portato cost?",
    "feeAnswer": "We don't set the prices - it's up to you! As a sender, you indicate the reward you're willing to offer, which serves as a starting point for negotiation with the driver. The driver will certainly do a little detour for you, so set a price that sets a good incentive for the driver to help you.",
    "deliveryGuaranteeQuestion": "Can Portato guarantee delivery?",
    "deliveryGuaranteeAnswer": "We're still at an early stage and our community of drivers is growing. Although we can't promise coverage for every request, we're doing our best to accommodate your needs. We often drive around with our portato truck perfoming deliveries ourselves. So chances are the driver you meet is actually someone from the portato team.",
    "insuranceQuestion": "Is my shipment insured through Portato?",
    "insuranceAnswer": "Not at the moment through Portato. If you wish to insure your items, you'd need to make arrangements yourself. However, we made it a priority to integrate insurance soon and are actively exploring partnerships with insurance providers at the moment.",
    "driverQuestion": "How does it work as a driver?",
    "driverAnswer": "We're stoked you want to help! Register your route, indicating the start and end points, timing, and available space in your vehicle. Whether it's your daily commute or a one-off journey, like a holiday trip, you're all set to earn along the way.",
    "paymentQuestion": "How do payments work?",
    "paymentAnswer": "At present, we don't process payments directly within the app. Payment arrangements are made directly between the sender and the driver. We're actively working on incorporating a payment system for a smoother experience in the near future.",
    "contactQuestion": "How can I get in touch with you?",
    "contactAnswer": "We're here for you anytime! Simply use the widget on the bottom right of this screen or write us an email to info@portato.io. We're looking forward to hearing from you!"

  "termsAndConditions": {
    "title": "Terms and conditions",
    "definitionOfTermsTitle": "Definition of terms",
    "definitionOfTermsText": "\"Sender\" in the context of these T&C is any user who creates a request for transportation services on this platform (Portato) and takes advantage of them for a specific price, regardless of whether that person is the sender or the recipient of the items to be transported. \"Driver\" in the context of these T&C is any person who provides transportation services through the use of this platform for a specific price. The term \"user\" in the context of these T&C refers to both senders and drivers.",
    "termsOfUseTitle": "Terms of use",
    "termsOfUseText": "The platform may only be used for the transportation of items that are allowed by applicable laws and regulations. The user must not transport any items that are illegal, dangerous, hazardous to health, or otherwise inappropriate. The platform reserves the right to block or exclude users from using the platform without giving reasons and without prior notice if these T&Cs or applicable law are violated.",
    "contractConclusionTitle": "Contract conclusion",
    "contractConclusionText": "Senders can create a transportation request on this platform by specifying the items to be transported, the date for transportation, and a pick-up and delivery location. Drivers can register the date and route of planned trips and thereby indicate their willingness to offer transportation services along the way. Users are obligated to provide all information that is relevant to the transportation truthfully and completely. The user is liable for damages that arise due to false or incomplete information. Neither the creation of a shipping request nor the offering of a transportation service constitutes a legally binding contract offer. Portato is not obligated to mediate a transportation request or to offer transportation services itself. However, the platform will do everything within its power to bring together users and drivers who have an interest in performing a transportation service. A transportation request is considered accepted as soon as both sender and driver confirm the transportation request. The transportation contract is concluded between the user and the driver, not between the user and the platform. The driver is obligated to transport the items carefully, deliver them punctually, and ensure that they arrive at the recipient in proper condition. The driver is liable for damages that occur during transportation, unless they are attributable to force majeure or unforeseen events. The sender is obligated to ensure a smooth transfer of items from the sender to the driver and from the driver to the recipient. The transportation contract ends as soon as the items have arrived at the recipient and the recipient has confirmed receipt without objections to the sender and Portato.",
    "pricesAndPaymentsTitle": "Prices and payments",
    "pricesAndPaymentsText": "Portato does not charge a fee for using the platform. The prices for the transportation services are negotiated between the shippers and drivers before the contract is concluded. The platform has no influence on pricing and does not assume any liability for the prices. The sender is obligated to pay the agreed transportation costs to the driver before the end of the contract.",
    "liabilityExclusionTitle": "Liability exclusion",
    "liabilityExclusionText": "Portato does not accept complaints for non-performance or poor performance of transportation services and assumes no responsibility or liability for damages that may occur during the transportation of goods. The users bear the risk of damages, losses, or theft themselves. It is recommended that senders properly package and insure their items to minimize any potential damages or losses.",
    "jurisdictionTitle": "Jurisdiction",
    "jurisdictionText": "For any disputes arising from or in connection with the T&Cs or the use of the platform, Swiss law shall apply. The jurisdiction shall be Zurich. This applies also to lawsuits in the bill of exchange or check proceedings as well as for lawsuits due to check incidents. The platform and the user waive the right to claim jurisdiction in another court, where a court competent for the user based on residence or international private law would have to decide the dispute."

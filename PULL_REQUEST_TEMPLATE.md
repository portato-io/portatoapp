<h4>Questions to ask yourself when reviewing:</h4>

- Do I understand which problem the merge request will solve?
- Is the work I see complete?
  - No bugs or open corner cases?
  - Is all the needed documentation there?
  - Is the UX/UI according to a mockup by the UX designer or as discussed in the team? Or is it small/simple enough to be decided between myself and the PR author alone?
  - Are all the user visible messages small and sane or discussed with the UX designer and translatable?
  - Are all dialogs working in the dialogs debug setup?
- Have I tested the code at least once on all relevant use cases, platforms and with mocklink, SITL or an actual plane as necessary or have I double checked with the PR author that this has happened?
- Is the code quality according to coding guidelines?
- Small-but-annoying stuff like typos etc.

<h4>Reactions to review findings:</h4>

- **Opinion Piece**
  - Add [OP] to your comment
  - Code that is OK like it is but could be solved otherwise.
- **Just-do-it**
  - Add [JDI] to your comment
  - Trivial stuff like typos that can be fixed without further review.
- **Regular finding**
  - Add a normal comment
  - A finding that needs changing and discussion. The author is supposed to fix it and let it be reviewed again.
- **Blocker**
  - Add a normal comment and discuss offline asap
  - A finding that the reviewer considers going against good practices or fundamentally flawed. Severe rewriting and fixing are in order
- **Praise**
  - Add an emoji ;)
  - If the code is awesome, give feedback
